# p-distance calculator
# lteasnail 20150505
##
# This script will calculate the uncorrected pairwise-distance
# (p-distance) between two specified sequences. P-distance is calculated by
# counting the number of bases that differ between the two sequences and
# dividing the number of differences by the length of the alignment minus any
# base pairs which are missing in either sequence. The sequences need to be
# aligned and the alignments need to be of the same length.
##
# Run as follows:
# python p-distance_script.py sample1 sample2 ~ *.fasta > p_distance_table.txt
